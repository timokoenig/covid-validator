  "information.purpose": "What is the purpose of CovidValidator?",
  "information.purpose.message": "<b>CovidValidator</b> allows you to scan and validate EU Digital Covid Certificates based on country or local rules. It gives the person that checks the certificate only as little personal information as possible to protect the users' privacy. This web app is an alternative to other existing products because it does not rely on certain app stores or country restrictions.",
  "information.rules": "What rules are being used?",
  "information.rules.message": "The app uses the official EU entry rules to validate the certificate. These rules are being provided by the member countries of the Digital Covid Certificate. It is a known problem that those rules might be out of date and do not reflect state or local regulations. This project adds additional rules, like state rules for Germany, to provide the verifier with more up-to-date rules.",
