It gives the person that checks the certificate only as little personal information as possible to protect the users' privacy. This web app is an alternative to other existing products because it does not rely on certain app stores or country restrictions.",

  "information.rules.message": "At the moment the app uses the official EU entry rules to validate the certificate. These rules are being provided by the member countries of the Digital Covid Certificate. It is a known problem that those rules might be out of date and does not reflect state or local regulations. This project is working on a custom rule builder that allows more precise rules for local regulations. You can follow the development <1>here</1>.",
