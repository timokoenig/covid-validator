## Developer Notes

The qr code reader needs to run over localhost or ssl to work. For the local development follow the script on https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/10935#discussioncomment-1540436 and run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` to get your address. Now you can access your dev build via https on your network.
