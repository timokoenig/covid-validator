### What is the purpose of CovidValidator?

**CovidValidator** allows you to scan and validate EU Digital Covid Certificates based on country or local rules. It gives the person that checks the certificate only as little personal information as possible to protect the users' privacy. This web app is an alternative to other existing products because it does not rely on certain app stores or country restrictions.

### What does BETA mean?

The web app is still in active development and might contain minor bugs. The production use of this app is not recommended yet, so please use it with caution. Updates will come regularly.

### What rules are being used?

At the moment, the app uses the official [EU DCC Validation Rules](#eu-dcc-validation-rules) to validate the certificate. These rules are being provided by the member countries of the Digital Covid Certificate. It is a known problem that those rules might be out of date and do not reflect state or local regulations. This project is working on a custom rule builder that allows more precise rules for local regulations. You can follow the development [here](https://github.com/timokoenig/covid-validator/issues/4).

## EU Digital Covid Certificate

A [EU Digital Covid Certificate](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en) (**EU DCC**) is a digital proof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19, has recovered from COVID-19 or has a test result. Therefore, the EU Digital COVID Certificate refers collectively to 3 types of certificates: vaccination, recovery and test. ([ref](https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/ehealth-and-covid-19_en))

**Key features of the certificate** ([ref](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en))

- Digital and/or paper format
- with QR code
- free of charge
- in national language and English
- safe and secure
- valid in all EU countries

### Signature Verification

The QR code on every certificate has a digital signature to protect it against falsification and it is being checked every time the QR code is scanned. Those signatures are being created by issuing entities, like hospitals, test centers, and health authorities. The public keys are shared through a European gateway with the member countries. The countries then provide additional software to allow the download of those keys. Read more about the update flow [here](https://github.com/Digitaler-Impfnachweis/certification-apis/blob/master/dsc-update/README.md).

**CovidValidation** uses a Github Action to fetch the newest DSC list once a day from the following API.

- API: [de.dscg.ubirch.com](https://de.dscg.ubirch.com/trustList/DSC/)
- Data Schema: [github.com/Digitaler-Impfnachweis/certification-apis](https://github.com/Digitaler-Impfnachweis/certification-apis/blob/master/dsc-update/README.md#data-schema)

The verification takes place in `async function verifyDCC(dcc: DCC): Promise<boolean>` ([link](https://github.com/timokoenig/covid-validator/blob/bbf92a6df5ad56463d8e6fd47190ed4a1f023b3a/utils/dcc.ts#L219)). Every time a certificate is scanned, the app checks for the _kid_ in the CBOR Web Token and searches for the matching DSC. If no _kid_ is available, then all DSCs will be used to verify the certificate. The app uses [cose-js](https://github.com/erdtman/COSE-JS) to verify the signature of the DCC. If the check fails, the user will get an error message that the certificate is technically invalid.

### Test Data

You can find a repository with test certificates [here](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dcc-quality-assurance).

**IMPORTANT**: At the moment **CovidValidator** only supports production certificates. The debug build will soon handle test certificates as well.

## EU DCC Validation Rules

The [EU DCC Validation Rules](https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2021-06/eu-dcc_validation-rules_en_0.pdf) allow a verifier to check if a DCC holder fulfills all requirements to enter a country. You, as a verifier, can change the rules by selecting a different country in the app. Always make sure to select the rules that are required by law in your country, otherwise the verification results might be invalid.

**CovidValidation** uses a Github Action to fetch the newest rules and value sets once a day from the EU Digital COVID Certificate Business Rule Service.

## Developer Notes

The QR code reader needs to run over localhost or SSL to work. For the local development, follow the script on https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/10935#discussioncomment-1540436 and run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` to get your address. Now you can access your dev build via HTTPS on your network.

## i18n

The app uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization. We want to offer this app to as many people as possible therefore native translations are important. We welcome anyone to help us translate this app. To do so, follow these steps:

1. If the language does not exist, create a folder in _/translations_ and copy the files _/translations/en/common.json_ and _/translations/en/country.json_ in that folder
2. Translate the existing values in those files and make sure you do not change the key
3. In case of a new language, please follow the next three steps, otherwise jump to _4)_
   a) Add the translation for the new language to the other _common.json_ files
   b) Add the language key to the `const availableLanguages = ['en', 'de']` array in _components/modal/settings.tsx_
   c) Add the i18next resource to `pages/_app.tsx` similar to the other languages
4. Save and commit your changes

Note: If you do not add a translation in any given language, the app will default to English.
